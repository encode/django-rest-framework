# Contributing to REST framework

At this point in it's lifespan we consider Django REST framework to be essentially feature-complete. We may accept pull requests that track the continued development of Django versions, but would prefer not to accept new features or code formatting changes.

Apart from minor documentation changes, the [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/discussions) should generally be your starting point. Please only raise an issue or pull request if you've been recommended to do so after discussion.

The [Contributing guide in the documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/contributing/) gives some more information on our process and code of conduct.
