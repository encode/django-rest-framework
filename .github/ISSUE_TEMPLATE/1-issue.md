## Checklist

- [ ] Raised initially as discussion #...
- [ ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be [in the form of third party libraries](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/third-party-packages/#about-third-party-packages) where possible.)
- [ ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
