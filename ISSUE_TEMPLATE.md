- [ ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be [in the form of third party libraries](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/third-party-resources/#about-third-party-packages) where possible.)
- [ ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
- [ ] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
