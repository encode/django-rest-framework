# Overview

Django REST framework is a lightweight library that makes it easy to build Web APIs.  It is designed as a modular and easy to customize architecture, based on Django's class based views.

Web APIs built using REST framework are fully self-describing and web browsable - a huge useability win for your developers.  It also supports a wide range of media types, authentication and permission policies out of the box.

If you are considering using REST framework for your API, we recommend reading the [REST framework 2 announcement][rest-framework-2-announcement] which gives a good overview of the framework and it's capabilities.

There is also a sandbox API you can use for testing purposes, [available here][sandbox].

# Requirements

* Python (2.6.5+, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3)
* Django (1.3, 1.4, 1.5)

**Optional:**

* [Markdown][markdown] - Markdown support for the self describing API.
* [PyYAML][pyyaml] - YAML content type support.
* [defusedxml][defusedxml] - XML content-type support.
* [django-filter][django-filter] - Filtering support.

# Installation

Install using `pip`, including any optional packages you want...

    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install markdown  # Markdown support for the browsable API.
    pip install pyyaml    # YAML content-type support.
    pip install defusedxml  # XML content-type support.
    pip install django-filter  # Filtering support

...or clone the project from github.

    git clone git@github.com:tomchristie/django-rest-framework.git
    cd django-rest-framework
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r optionals.txt

Add `'rest_framework'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'rest_framework',        
    )

If you're intending to use the browsable API you'll probably also want to add REST framework's login and logout views.  Add the following to your root `urls.py` file.

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
    )

Note that the URL path can be whatever you want, but you must include `'rest_framework.urls'` with the `'rest_framework'` namespace.

# Development

To build the docs.

    ./mkdocs.py

To run the tests.

    ./rest_framework/runtests/runtests.py

To run the tests against all supported configurations, first install [the tox testing tool][tox] globally, using `pip install tox`, then simply run `tox`:
