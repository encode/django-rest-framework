# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues are handled under the supervision of the [Django security team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#security-team).

 **Please report security issues by emailing security@djangoproject.com**.

 The project maintainers will then work with you to resolve any issues where required, prior to any public disclosure.
