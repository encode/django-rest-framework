# Django REST framework

**A toolkit for building well-connected, self-describing Web APIs.**

**WARNING: This documentation is for the 2.0 redesign of REST framework.  It is a work in progress.**

Django REST framework is a lightweight library that makes it easy to build Web APIs.  It is designed as a modular and easy to customize architecture, based on Django's class based views.

Web APIs built using REST framework are fully self-describing and web browseable - a huge useability win for your developers.  It also supports a wide range of media types, authentication and permission policies out of the box.

## Requirements

REST framework requires the following:

* Python (2.6, 2.7)
* Django (1.3, 1.4, 1.5)

The following packages are optional:

* [Markdown][markdown] (2.1.0+) - Markdown support for the self describing API.
* [PyYAML][yaml] (3.10+) - YAML content-type support.

## Installation

**WARNING: These instructions will only become valid once this becomes the master version**

Install using `pip`, including any optional packages you want...

    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install markdown  # Recommended if using the browseable API.
    pip install pyyaml    # Required for yaml content-type support.

...or clone the project from github.

    git clone git@github.com:tomchristie/django-rest-framework.git
    cd django-rest-framework
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r optionals.txt

Add `rest_framework` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'rest_framework',        
    )

If you're intending to use the browseable API you'll want to add REST framework's login and logout views.  Add the following to your root `urls.py` file.

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
    )

Note that the URL path can be whatever you want, but you must include `rest_framework.urls` with the `rest_framework` namespace.

## Quickstart

Can't wait to get started?  The [quickstart guide][quickstart] is the fastest way to get up and running with REST framework.

## Tutorial

The tutorial will walk you through the building blocks that make up REST framework.   It'll take a little while to get through, but it'll give you a comprehensive understanding of how everything fits together, and is highly recommended reading.

* [1 - Serialization][tut-1]
* [2 - Requests & Responses][tut-2]
* [3 - Class based views][tut-3]
* [4 - Authentication & permissions][tut-4]
* [5 - Relationships & hyperlinked APIs][tut-5]

## Development

If you want to work on REST framework itself, clone the repository, then...

Build the docs:

    ./mkdocs.py

Run the tests:

    ./rest_framework/runtests/runtests.py

For more information see the [Contributing to REST framework][contributing] section.
## Support

For support please see the [REST framework discussion group][group], or try the  `#restframework` channel on `irc.freenode.net`.

Paid support is also available from [DabApps], and can include work on REST framework core, or support with building your REST framework API.  Please contact [Tom Christie][email] if you'd like to discuss commercial support options.
