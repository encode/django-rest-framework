Examples
========

There are a few real world web API examples included with Django REST framework.

#. :doc:`examples/objectstore` - Using :class:`views.View` classes for APIs that do not map to models.
#. :doc:`examples/pygments` - Using :class:`views.View` classes with forms for input validation.
#. :doc:`examples/blogpost` - Using :class:`views.ModelView` classes for APIs that map directly to models.

All the examples are freely available for testing in the sandbox:

    http://rest.ep.io

(The :doc:`examples/sandbox` resource is also documented.)
