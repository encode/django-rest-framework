## Breaking Changes

### Altered behaviour of `read_only` plus `default` on Field.

[#5886][gh5886]

`read_only` fields will now **always** be excluded from writable fields.

Previously `read_only` fields with a `default` value would use the `default` for create and update operations.

In order to maintain the old behaviour you may need to pass the value of `read_only` fields when calling `save()` in
the view:

    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        serializer.save(owner=self.request.user)

Alternatively you may override `save()` or `create()` or `update()` on the serialiser as appropriate.
