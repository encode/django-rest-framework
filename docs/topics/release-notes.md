## 0.2.0

* Big refactoring changes since 0.1.0, ask on the discussion group if anything isn't clear.
  The public API has been massively cleaned up.  Expect it to be fairly stable from here on in.

* ``Resource`` becomes decoupled into ``View`` and ``Resource``, your views should now inherit from ``View``, not ``Resource``.

* The handler functions on views ``.get() .put() .post()`` etc, no longer have the ``content`` and ``auth`` args.
  Use ``self.CONTENT`` inside a view to access the deserialized, validated content.
  Use ``self.user`` inside a view to access the authenticated user.

* ``allowed_methods`` and ``anon_allowed_methods`` are now defunct.  if a method is defined, it's available.
  The ``permissions`` attribute on a ``View`` is now used to provide generic permissions checking.
  Use permission classes such as ``FullAnonAccess``, ``IsAuthenticated`` or ``IsUserOrIsAnonReadOnly`` to set the permissions.

* The ``authenticators`` class becomes ``authentication``.  Class names change to ``Authentication``.

* The ``emitters`` class becomes ``renderers``.  Class names change to ``Renderers``.

* ``ResponseException`` becomes ``ErrorResponse``.

* The mixin classes have been nicely refactored, the basic mixins are now ``RequestMixin``, ``ResponseMixin``, ``AuthMixin``, and ``ResourceMixin``
  You can reuse these mixin classes individually without using the ``View`` class.

## 0.1.1

* Final build before pulling in all the refactoring changes for 0.2, in case anyone needs to hang on to 0.1.

## 0.1.0

* Initial release.
