# Release Notes

> Release Early, Release Often
>
> &mdash; Eric S. Raymond, [The Cathedral and the Bazaar][cite].

## Versioning

Minor version numbers (0.0.x) are used for changes that are API compatible.  You should be able to upgrade between minor point releases without any other code changes.

Medium version numbers (0.x.0) may include API changes, in line with the [deprecation policy][deprecation-policy].  You should read the release notes carefully before upgrading between medium point releases.

Major version numbers (x.0.0) are reserved for substantial project milestones.  No major point releases are currently planned.

## Deprecation policy

REST framework releases follow a formal deprecation policy, which is in line with [Django's deprecation policy][django-deprecation-policy].

The timeline for deprecation of a feature present in version 1.0 would work as follows:

* Version 1.1 would remain **fully backwards compatible** with 1.0, but would raise `PendingDeprecationWarning` warnings if you use the feature that are due to be deprecated.  These warnings are **silent by default**, but can be explicitly enabled when you're ready to start migrating any required changes.  For example if you start running your tests using `python -Wd manage.py test`, you'll be warned of any API changes you need to make.

* Version 1.2 would escalate these warnings to `DeprecationWarning`, which is loud by default.

* Version 1.3 would remove the deprecated bits of API entirely.

Note that in line with Django's policy, any parts of the framework not mentioned in the documentation should generally be considered private API, and may be subject to change.

## Upgrading

To upgrade Django REST framework to the latest version, use pip:

    pip install -U djangorestframework

You can determine your currently installed version using `pip freeze`:

    pip freeze | grep djangorestframework

---

### 2.4.0

* Added compatibility with Django 1.7's native migrations.

  **IMPORTANT**: In order to continue to use South with Django <1.7 you **must** upgrade to
  South v1.0.

* Use py.test
* `@detail_route` and `@list_route` decorators replace `@action` and `@link`.
* `six` no longer bundled.  For Django <= 1.4.1, install `six` package.

* Added `NUM_PROXIES` setting for smarter client IP identification.
* Added `MAX_PAGINATE_BY` setting and `max_paginate_by` generic view attribute.
* Added `cache` attribute to throttles to allow overriding of default cache.
* Bugfix: `?page_size=0` query parameter now falls back to default page size for view, instead of always turning pagination off.


## 2.3.x series

**Date**: 12th June 2014

* **Security fix**: Escape request path when it is include as part of the login and logout links in the browsable API.
* `help_text` and `verbose_name` automatically set for related fields on `ModelSerializer`.

### 2.3.12

**Date**: 15th January 2014

* **Security fix**: `OrderingField` now only allows ordering on readable serializer fields, or on fields explicitly specified using `ordering_fields`. This prevents users being able to order by fields that are not visible in the API, and exploiting the ordering of sensitive data such as password hashes.
* Bugfix: `write_only = True` fields now display in the browsable API.

### 2.3.11

**Date**: 14th January 2014

* Bugfix: Responses without any content no longer include an HTTP `'Content-Type'` header.
* Bugfix: Correctly handle validation errors in PUT-as-create case, responding with 400.

### 2.3.9

* 'Raw data' tab in browsable API now contains pre-populated data.
* 'Raw data' and 'HTML form' tab preference in browseable API now saved between page views.
* Bugfix: `required=True` argument fixed for boolean serializer fields.
* Bugfix: `client.force_authenticate(None)` should also clear session info if it exists.
* Bugfix: Client sending empty string instead of file now clears `FileField`.
* Bugfix: Empty values on ChoiceFields with `required=False` now consistently return `None`.
* Bugfix: Clients setting `page_size=0` now simply returns the default page size, instead of disabling pagination. [*]

---

[*] Note that the change in `page_size=0` behaviour fixes what is considered to be a bug in how clients can effect the pagination size.  However if you were relying on this behavior you will need to add the following mixin to your list views in order to preserve the existing behavior.

    class DisablePaginationMixin(object):
        def get_paginate_by(self, queryset=None):
            if self.request.QUERY_PARAMS[self.paginate_by_param] == '0':
                return None
            return super(DisablePaginationMixin, self).get_paginate_by(queryset)

* Bugfix: Fix 500 error is OAuth not attempted with OAuthAuthentication class installed.
* `Serializer.save()` now supports arbitrary keyword args which are passed through to the object `.save()` method.  Mixins use `force_insert` and `force_update` where appropriate, resulting in one less database query.

### 2.2.2

**Date**: 6th March 2013

* Support for custom input and output formats for `DateField`, `DateTimeField` and `TimeField`.
* Cleanup: Request authentication is no longer lazily evaluated, instead authentication is always run, which results in more consistent, obvious behavior.  Eg. Supplying bad auth credentials will now always return an error response, even if no permissions are set on the view.
* Bugfix for serializer data being uncacheable with pickle protocol 0.
* Bugfixes for model field validation edge-cases.
* Bugfix for authtoken migration while using a custom user model and south.

### 2.2.1

**Date**: 22nd Feb 2013

**Security note**: Following the [disclosure of security vulnerabilities][defusedxml-announce] in Python's XML parsing libraries, use of the `XMLParser` class now requires the `defusedxml` package to be installed.

The security vulnerabilities only affect APIs which use the `XMLParser` class, by enabling it in any views, or by having it set in the `DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES` setting.  Note that the `XMLParser` class is not enabled by default, so this change should affect a minority of users.

* Added a `post_save()` hook to the generic views.
* Allow serializers to handle dicts as well as objects.

* Deprecate optional `obj` argument in permissions checks in favor of `has_object_permission`.
* Deprecate implicit hyperlinked relations behavior.
* Bugfix: Fix broken DjangoModelPermissions.
* Bugfix: Allow serializer output to be cached.
* Bugfix: Fix styling on browsable API login.
* Bugfix: Fix issue with deserializing empty to-many relations.

**Note**: If the primary authentication class is `TokenAuthentication` or `BasicAuthentication`, a view will now correctly return 401 responses to unauthenticated access, with an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` header, instead of 403 responses.

### 2.1.16

**Date**: 14th Jan 2013

* Deprecate `django.utils.simplejson` in favor of Python 2.6's built-in json module.
* Bugfix: `auto_now`, `auto_now_add` and other `editable=False` fields now default to read-only.

* Bugfix: Validation errors instead of exceptions when related fields receive incorrect types.
* Bugfix: Handle ObjectDoesNotExist exception when serializing null reverse one-to-one

**Note**: Prior to 2.1.16, The Decimals would render in JSON using floating point if `simplejson` was installed, but otherwise render using string notation.  Now that use of `simplejson` has been deprecated, Decimals will consistently render using string notation.  See [#582] for more details.

* Added `RetrieveUpdateAPIView`.
* Remove unused internal `save_m2m` flag on `ModelSerializer.save()`.

**Note**: From 2.1.14 onwards, relational fields move out of the `fields.py` module and into the new `relations.py` module, in order to separate them from regular data type fields, such as `CharField` and `IntegerField`.

This change will not affect user code, so long as it's following the recommended import style of `from rest_framework import serializers` and referring to fields using the style `serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField`.


### 2.1.13

**Date**: 28th Dec 2012

### 0.2.0

* Big refactoring changes since 0.1.0, ask on the discussion group if anything isn't clear.
  The public API has been massively cleaned up.  Expect it to be fairly stable from here on in.

* ``Resource`` becomes decoupled into ``View`` and ``Resource``, your views should now inherit from ``View``, not ``Resource``.

* The handler functions on views ``.get() .put() .post()`` etc, no longer have the ``content`` and ``auth`` args.
  Use ``self.CONTENT`` inside a view to access the deserialized, validated content.
  Use ``self.user`` inside a view to access the authenticated user.

* ``allowed_methods`` and ``anon_allowed_methods`` are now defunct.  if a method is defined, it's available.
  The ``permissions`` attribute on a ``View`` is now used to provide generic permissions checking.
  Use permission classes such as ``FullAnonAccess``, ``IsAuthenticated`` or ``IsUserOrIsAnonReadOnly`` to set the permissions.

* The ``authenticators`` class becomes ``authentication``.  Class names change to ``Authentication``.

* The ``emitters`` class becomes ``renderers``.  Class names change to ``Renderers``.

* ``ResponseException`` becomes ``ErrorResponse``.

* The mixin classes have been nicely refactored, the basic mixins are now ``RequestMixin``, ``ResponseMixin``, ``AuthMixin``, and ``ResourceMixin``
  You can reuse these mixin classes individually without using the ``View`` class.
