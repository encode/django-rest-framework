# Working with the Browsable API

API may stand for Application *Programming* Interface, but humans have to be able to read the APIs, too; someone has to do the programming. Django REST Framework supports generating human-friendly HTML output for each resource when the `HTML` format is requested. These pages allow for easy browsing of resources, as well as forms for submitting data to the resources using `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

## URLs

If you include fully-qualified URLs in your resource output, they will be 'urlized' and made clickable for easy browsing by humans. The `djangorestframework` package includes a [`reverse`][drfreverse] helper for this purpose.


## Formats

By default, the API will return the format specified by the headers, which in the case of the browser is HTML. The format can be specified using `?format=` in the request, so you can look at the raw JSON response in a browser by adding `?format=json` to the URL. There are helpful extensions for viewing JSON in [Firefox][ffjsonview] and [Chrome][chromejsonview].


## Customizing

To customize the look-and-feel, create a template called `api.html` and add it to your project, eg: `templates/djangorestframework/api.html`, that extends the `djangorestframework/base.html` template.

The included browsable API template is built with [Bootstrap (2.1.1)][bootstrap], making it easy to customize the look-and-feel.

### Theme

To replace the theme wholesale, add a `bootstrap_theme` block to your `api.html` and insert a `link` to the desired Bootstrap theme css file. This will completely replace the included theme.

    {% block bootstrap_theme %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/my/bootstrap.css" type="text/css">
    {% endblock %}

A suitable replacement theme can be generated using Bootstrap's [Customize Tool][bcustomize]. Also, there are pre-made themes available at [Bootswatch][bswatch]. To use any of the Bootswatch themes, simply download the theme's `bootstrap.min.css` file, add it to your project, and replace the default one as described above.

You can also change the navbar variant, which by default is `navbar-inverse`, using the `bootstrap_navbar_variant` block. The empty `{% block bootstrap_navbar_variant %}{% endblock %}` will use the original Bootstrap navbar style.

For more specific CSS tweaks, use the `extra_style` block instead.


### Blocks

All of the blocks available in the browsable API base template that can be used in your `api.html`.

* `blockbots`                  - `<meta>` tag that blocks crawlers
* `bodyclass`                  - (empty) class attribute for the `<body>`
* `bootstrap_theme`            - CSS for the Bootstrap theme
* `bootstrap_navbar_variant`   - CSS class for the navbar
* `branding`                   - section of the navbar, see [Bootstrap components][bcomponentsnav]
* `breadcrumbs`                - Links showing resource nesting, allowing the user to go back up the resources. It's recommended to preserve these, but they can be overridden using the breadcrumbs block.
* `extrastyle`                 - (empty) extra CSS for the page
* `extrahead`                  - (empty) extra markup for the page `<head>`
* `footer`                     - Any copyright notices or similar footer materials can go here (by default right-aligned)
* `global_heading`             - (empty) Use to insert content below the header but before the breadcrumbs.
* `title`                      - title of the page
* `userlinks`                  - This is a list of links on the right of the header, by default containing login/logout links. To add links instead of replace, use {{ block.super }} to preserve the authentication links.

#### Components

All of the [Bootstrap components][bcomponents] are available.

##### Tooltips

The browsable API makes use of the Bootstrap tooltips component. Any element with the `js-tooltip` class and a `title` attribute has that title content displayed in a tooltip on hover after a 1000ms delay.


### Advanced Customization

#### Context

The context that's available to the template:

* `allowed_methods`     : A list of methods allowed by the resource
* `api_settings`        : The API settings
* `available_formats`   : A list of formats allowed by the resource
* `breadcrumblist`      : The list of links following the chain of nested resources
* `content`             : The content of the API response
* `description`         : The description of the resource, generated from its docstring
* `name`                : The name of the resource
* `post_form`           : A form instance for use by the POST form (if allowed)
* `put_form`            : A form instance for use by the PUT form (if allowed)
* `request`             : The request object
* `response`            : The response object
* `version`             : The version of Django REST Framework
* `view`                : The view handling the request
* `FORMAT_PARAM`        : The view can accept a format override
* `METHOD_PARAM`        : The view can accept a method override

#### Not using base.html

For more advanced customization, such as not having a Bootstrap basis or tighter integration with the rest of your site, you can simply choose not to have `api.html` extend `base.html`. Then the page content and capabilities are entirely up to you.
