## About Third Party Packages

Third Party Packages allow developers to share code that extends the functionality of Django REST framework, in order to support additional use-cases.

We **support**, **encourage** and **strongly favor** the creation of Third Party Packages to encapsulate new behavior rather than adding additional functionality directly to Django REST Framework.

We aim to make creating third party packages as easy as possible, whilst keeping a **simple** and **well maintained** core API. By promoting third party packages we ensure that the responsibility for a package remains with its author. If a package proves suitably popular it can always be considered for inclusion into the core REST framework.

If you have an idea for a new feature please consider how it may be packaged as a Third Party Package. We're always happy to discuss ideas on the [Mailing List][discussion-group].

## Creating a Third Party Package

### Version compatibility

Sometimes, in order to ensure your code works on various different versions of Django, Python or third party libraries, you'll need to run slightly different code depending on the environment. Any code that branches in this way should be isolated into a `compat.py` module, and should provide a single common interface that the rest of the codebase can use.

Check out Django REST framework's [compat.py][drf-compat] for an example.

### Once your package is available

Once your package is decently documented and available on PyPI, you might want share it with others that might find it useful.

#### Adding to the Django REST framework grid

We suggest adding your package to the [REST Framework][rest-framework-grid] grid on Django Packages.

#### Adding to the Django REST framework docs

Create a [Pull Request][drf-create-pr] or [Issue][drf-create-issue] on GitHub, and we'll add a link to it from the main REST framework documentation. You can add your package under **Third party packages** of the API Guide section that best applies, like [Authentication][authentication] or [Permissions][permissions]. You can also link your package under the [Third Party Packages][third-party-packages] section.

#### Announce on the discussion group.

You can also let others know about your package through the [discussion group][discussion-group].

## Existing Third Party Packages

Django REST Framework has a growing community of developers, packages, and resources.

Check out a grid detailing all the packages and ecosystem around Django REST Framework at [Django Packages][rest-framework-grid].

To submit new content, [open an issue][drf-create-issue] or [create a pull request][drf-create-pr].
