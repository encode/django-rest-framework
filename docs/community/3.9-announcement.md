## ViewSet _Extra Actions_ available in the Browsable API

Following the introduction of the `action` decorator in v3.8, _extra actions_ defined on a ViewSet are now available
from the Browsable API.

When defined, a dropdown of "Extra Actions", appropriately filtered to detail/non-detail actions, is displayed.

## In-built OpenAPI schema support

## Deprecations

### `DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter` moved to third-party package.

The `DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter` class is pending deprecation, will be deprecated in 3.10 and removed entirely in 3.11.

It has been moved to the third-party [`djangorestframework-guardian`](https://github.com/rpkilby/django-rest-framework-guardian)
package. Please use this instead.

### Router argument/method renamed to use `basename` for consistency.

* The `Router.register` `base_name` argument has been renamed in favor of `basename`.
* The `Router.get_default_base_name` method has been renamed in favor of `Router.get_default_basename`. [#5990][gh5990]

See [#5990][gh5990].

[gh5990]: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/pull/5990

`base_name` and `get_default_base_name()` are pending deprecation. They will be deprecated in 3.10 and removed entirely in 3.11.

### `action` decorator replaces `list_route` and `detail_route`

Both `list_route` and `detail_route` are now deprecated in favour of the single `action` decorator.
They will be removed entirely in 3.10.

The `action` decorator takes a boolean `detail` argument.

* Replace `detail_route` uses with `@action(detail=True)`.
* Replace `list_route` uses with `@action(detail=False)`.

### `exclude_from_schema`

Both `APIView.exclude_from_schema` and the `exclude_from_schema` argument to the `@api_view` have now been removed.

For `APIView` you should instead set a `schema = None` attribute on the view class.

For function based views the `@schema` decorator can be used to exclude the view from the schema, by using `@schema(None)`.
